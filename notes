Notes
I did not look into Heroku
I did not look into setting it up on my own server
I intend to look into side chapters on detail on my own later on

when meteor runs
if in the server directory, doesn't load in the browser, just runs automatically in the server

(page 13)
Code in the /serverdirectory only runs on the server.
Code in the /clientdirectory only runs on the client.
Everything else runs on both the client and server.
Files in /libare loaded before anything else.
Any main.*file is loaded after everything else.
Your static assets (fonts, images, etc.) go in the /publicdirectory

(page 36)
Code inside folders that are not client/or server/will run in bothcontexts. So the Posts
collection is available to both client and server. However, what the collection does in each
environment is very different.

(page 28)
Meteor's templating system, Handlebars. Handlebars is simply HTML, with
the addition of three things: partials, expressionsand block helpers.
Partialsuse the {{> templateName}}syntax, and simply tell Meteor to replace the partial with the
template of the same name (in our case postItem).
Expressionssuch as {{title}}either call a property of the current object, or the return value of a
template helper as defined in the current template's manager (more on this later).
Finally, block helpersare special tags that control the flow of the template, such as {{#each}}…
{{/each}}or {{#if}}…{{/if}}.
